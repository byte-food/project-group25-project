Group 25 - Air quality and it's changes throughout the day
Milestones

Global warming is an issue that affects all of us, despite social, economic class or ethnicity, the fact is the environment is crucial to our survival as a species.
Therefore I decided to study Air Quality data and try to find correlation of the spread of certain gases throughout the day, hopefully to get or understand how human routine affects our air and environment
